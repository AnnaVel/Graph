To Do:

Up next: test the memory taken by this version and the previous one.

1. Consider making the VertexStructure class public because at the moment the Graph class has API which only refers to teh VertexStructure class.

2. Come up with a way to represent edges. This will be necessary when making the UI.

3. Devise a way to remove only certain edge, not all edges between two vertices.
